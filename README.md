Live Map Values Plotting Codes and GUI for Dashboard
These files were created by me for an internal project for Equinox, the Space Club of PES University.

These files were used for:
1. LiveGraphTest.py is used to plot live coordinate values of an object like a Balloon, using Matplotlib. These coordinates are Map coods, in form of Latitudes & Longitudes.
2. GUI_for_text_and_img.py helps create a basic dashboard like layout to display text & images using the popular Python GUI Library, tkinter.
